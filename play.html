        <h1>Jahna Sri Aneela Ankam Presents</h1>
        <h2>Twelfth Night</h2>
        <h3>SCENE III. OLIVIA'S house.</h3>
<p class="stage-direction">Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA</p>
<h4 class="name">SIR TOBY BELCH</h4>
   <p class="speech"> What a plague means my niece, to take the death of
    her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.</p>
<h4 class="name">MARIA</h4>
   <p class="speech"> By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'
    nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great
    exceptions to your ill hours.</p>
<h4 class="name">SIR TOBY BELCH</h4>
    <p class="speech">Why, let her except, before excepted.</p>
<h4 class="name">MARIA</h4>
   <p class="speech"> Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest
    limits of order.</p>
<h4 class="name">SIR TOBY BELCH</h4>
    <p class="speech">Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:
    these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be
    these boots too: an they be not, let them hang
    themselves in their own straps.</p>
<h4 class="name">MARIA</h4>
    <p class="speech">That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard
    my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
    knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.</p>
<h4 class="name">SIR TOBY BELCH</h4>
    <p class="speech">Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?</p>
<h4 class="name">MARIA</h4>
    <p class="speech">Ay, he.</p>
<h4 class="name">SIR TOBY BELCH</h4>
    <p class="speech">He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.</p>
